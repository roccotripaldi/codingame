# Solutions for Codingame.com Puzzles

I've found the puzzles on codingame.com to be satisfying. They've taught me new techniques and they're highly addictive.
I'm going to put some of my favorite solutions here as something of a coding diary.

Please feel free to use them if you are feeling stuck on one. Or submit a PR if you have a different approach you'd like to share.
