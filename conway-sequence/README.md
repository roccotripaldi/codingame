# Conway Sequence

This is not the first I've heard the good name of Conway. He's the one who invented the [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). No, not the board game dumbo.

After solving [this puzzle](https://www.codingame.com/games/puzzles/?puzzleId=15), which needs to display any given line of the Conway sequence with a given root, I came up with this meme for social media that could drive your friends and family crazy! Please feel free to share it.
